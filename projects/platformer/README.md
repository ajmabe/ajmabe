# Objective 
# (Must Read)

The goal is to design one level of a platformer game using the functions defined in the `js/factory` folder. DO NOT WORK IN THAT FOLDER. You will call these functions in the corresponding files located in the `js/init` folder to create the platforms, add cannons, and collectables that Halle must collect. To test your project, you will need to preview the `index.html` file found in your `platformer` folder.

It's up to you to design a level that is challenging but doable. Consider <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/category/tweens" target="_blank">tweening</a> platforms, cannons, and collectables for an additional challenge.

## Where to Code?

Open up your `platformer` folder. Then, open up 3 files:

1. `js/init/platform.js`: Follow the instructions outlined in the file to design all required platforms for the game level.
2. `js/init/cannon.js`: Follow the instructions outlined in the file to design all required cannons for the game level.
3. `js/init/collectable.js`: Follow the instructions outlined in the file to design all required collectables for the game level.

You see instructions on **where to write your code** - keep your code in between the areas **ALL YOUR CODE GOES BELOW HERE** and **ALL YOUR CODE GOES ABOVE HERE**. This will help you make less errors. For example:

```
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// ALL YOUR CODE GOES BELOW HERE ///////////////////////////////////////

createCollectable(type.steve, 200, 170, 6, 0.7);

// ALL YOUR CODE GOES ABOVE HERE ///////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
```

Code a little, **save your work** (Command / Ctrl + s), switch back to the tab running your game and **refresh the page** (Command / Ctrl + r) to see your work!

Have fun!

## Requirements and Grading
1. 30% : You must create at least 3 cannons in different locations. 
2. 30% : You must have at least 3 collectables of different types.
3. 30% : You must include at least 5 platforms 
4. 10% : Your game must be playable!

## Functions
## (Can skip if comfortable with functions)

Functions are predefined blocks of code that can accept input, perform an action, and can return a value. They can be reused many times to perform that action on command.

A **Function Declaration** determines what data the function accepts, what operations are performed, and what value is returned. 

Here is an example of a Function Declaration called `createCannon`:

```javascript
function create(x, y, scaleX, scaleY, immovable) {
    var platform = game.platforms.create(x, y, 'platform');
    platform.scale.setTo(scaleX || 1, scaleY || 1);
    platform.body.immovable = immovable || true;
    return platform;
}
```

This Function accepts 5 pieces of input data: `(x, y, scaleX, scaleY, immovable)`, called **Parameters**. The Function uses that data to create a platform which is returned by the Function. 

Function Declaration simply define how a function operates - it does not execute the code until a **Function Call** is made.

Here is an example of a function call to the `create` function:

```javascript
createPlatform(400, 200, 1, 2, true);
```

A function call can be made by providing the same headline as the function definition but with actual data values, or **Arguments**, in the place of the parameters. 

Calling the Function tells the computer to jump into the Function Declaration and execute each line written in the `{ Code Block }` replacing each Parameter with an Argument.

This Function call will create a platform with an (x,y) location of `(400, 200)` with an X-Scale-Factor of `1`, ad Y-Scale-Factor of `2`, and the immovable property set to `true`. 

# Lesson Steps
# (Must Read All of this)

## Run the program
Right click on your `index.html` file and select "Preview with Live Server".

## TODO 1: Platforms

GOAL: Add as many platforms necessary to make your level challenging.

Find and open the file `js/init/platform.js` and use the the `createPlatform()` Function to create platforms for the level. 

`createPlatform()` takes these arguments: 

```javascript      
/*
createPlatform(x, y, scaleX, scaleY);
 
x: The x coordinate for the platform.
y: The y coordinate for the platform.
scaleX: OPTIONAL The scale factor on the x-axis, this value will stretch the platform in width.
scaleY: OPTIONAL The scale factor on the y-axis, this value will stretch the platform in height.
*/
 ```

Here is an example function call:

```javascript
createPlatform(400, 460);           // normal platform
createPlatform(300, 200, 0.3)       // small horizontal platform (30% the normal width)
createPlatform(500, 500, 0.3, 10)   // tall vertical wall (30% the normal width and 10x the height)
```

<hr> 

# Very Important:
1) In most 2D games, the y-axis is inverted. This means that a y value of 500 is closer to the bottom of your screen than a y value of 100. For examples of what this means, click on the "examples" button below. 
2) The dimensions of your game world are **900 x 700**, so keep that in mind as you move forward.

`createPlatform(0, 100)` puts a platform here

## TODO 2: Collectables

GOAL: Add as many collectables as necessary (at least 3, and remember they need to be of different types) to make your level challenging.

Find and open the file `js/init/collectable.js` and use the `createCollectable()` Function to create collectables for the level. 

`createCollectable()` takes these arguments:

```javascript
/*
createCollectable(type, x, y, gravity, bounce);

type: The type of the collectable. 
x: The x coordinate for the collectable.
y: The y coordinate for the collectable.
gravity: OPTIONAL The gravitational pull on the collectable.
bounce: OPTIONAL A factor effecting how much the collectable will bounce off platforms, etc.
*/
```

Here is an example function call:

```javascript
createCollectable(type.steve, 200, 170, 6, 0.7);
```

Below are the following `types` available:

```javascript
type.db         // worth 10 points
type.max        // worth 20 points
type.steve      // worth 30 points
type.grace      // worth 40 points
type.kennedi    // worth 50 points
```

## TODO 3: Commit Your Working Code

### Important!

In the first website and portfolio projects, you ran three git commands - `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`- at the end of each project, and your code magically appeared on the internet on your own personal website. How exactly did that happen, and what is git?

### Git

Git is a software used for tracking changes to files and managing and controlling different versions of the same file. Git is a commonly used software for developers, and is frequently used throughout projects when changes to code are made and new features are implemented. Github uses Git to help keep track of changes to code, and when you use the `git push` command, all of the commits you have made using `git commit` are sent to Github to keep track of.

#### Note

You've probably heard someone say you should always back up your computer to preserve anything in case it randomly decides to crash? Running these git commands is essentially the same thing! If anything should happen to your workspace and your work gets deleted, Github saves a copy of all your work whenever you run these commands. "Git" into the habit of running these commands every day in your workspace when you are coding -- it is always better to over commit than under commit!

For this project and future projects, you'll commit and push work more frequently to better manage your workflow and track changes to your code.

In your bash terminal, enter the following commands, pressing ENTER after each one.

`git add .`

`git commit -m 'add platforms and collectables to game'`

<ul> <li style="list-style-type: none;">
A note about `git commit` - When you save a document on your computer, you usually give your document a title so you can find it later. The same applies with a `git commit` command - the message identifies different versions of your file. In between the quotes, you always want to include a short description of why you are pushing your code to Github - whether it's saying 'adding platforms', 'adding cannons', or simply a message saying 'My teacher told me to commit so I do not lose my work' would work!
</li></ul>

`git push`

<hr>

## TODO 4: Cannons

GOAL: Add as many cannons as necessary (at least 3) to make your level challenging. 

Find and open the file `js/init/cannon.js` and use the `createCannon` Function to create cannons for the level. The `createCannon` Function takes these arguments:

```javascript
/*
createCannon(type, position, delay);

type: The type of cannon to be made. This can be one of the following Strings: "top", "bottom", "left", or "right"
position: The position coordinate for the cannon along the wall it is placed.
delay: OPTIONAL The number of milliseconds to wait before firing the first projectile

*/
```

Here is an example function call:

```javascript
createCannon("top", 450); // a cannon on the top of the screen, located at x = 450
createCannon("left", 300, 1000); // a cannon on the left side of the screen, located at y = 300, with a 1 second delay (1000ms)
```
<hr> 

### WARNING
**Placing the cannons outside of bounds of the game will cause it to crash instantly!**

## TODO 5: Make your level challenging!

Now that you have platforms, cannons, and collectables make your game unique and challenging! In order to get full credit your project must be playable! Specifically, 
* It must be possible to collect all collectables
* It must require changing height to reach at least some collectables (jumping, falling, or a combination)
* It must require active avoidance of cannon projectiles (i.e. you can't put all cannons in a corner)

###

<hr>

## TODO 6: Go Live

In your bash terminal, enter the following commands, pressing ENTER after each one:

`git add .`

`git commit -m 'add cannons to game'`

`git push`

Give it a couple minutes and you should be able to view the additions to your website live on the web at `username.github.io` (Where `username` is your own GitHub username.)

Great work! Pat yourselve on the back and show off your game!
